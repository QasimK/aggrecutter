# Aggrecutter

A web content/feed aggregator focused on being useful in a content-overloaded environment.

* Aggregate content from more than just RSS/Atom feeds.
* Automatically discover discussions of articles on your forums (e.g. Reddit, Hacker News).
* Allow you to identify and deprioritise low-quality content.
* Make your own notes, categorise/tag, and easily share these.
* Keep track of what you have read like any other feed reader.
